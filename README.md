# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How It Works

### 1. User Management:
- **View Users**: Displays a list of users fetched from the backend.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Users**: Forms are available to add new users, edit existing ones, or delete users.
- **Assign Roles**: Admin can assign roles (like Admin, User, etc.) to users during the user management process.

### 2. Role Management:
- **Create and Edit Roles**: Admin can create new roles or edit existing ones. For example, roles can include "Admin," "Editor," "Viewer," etc.
- **Assign Permissions**: Permissions such as **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** can be attached to each role, allowing admins to define the level of access.

### 3. Permissions Management:
- **Modify Permissions**: Admins can modify the permissions for each role. For example, the Admin role may have full access (Read, Write, Delete), while the User role may only have Read access.
  
### 4. Mock API (Backend):
- **JSON Server** is used to simulate the backend operations. All the data (users, roles, permissions) is stored in a mock database called `db.json`. The React app interacts with this mock API to fetch and update data.
